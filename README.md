# [BS] Ultrathin Metal Based Mid-infrared Emitters for Radiative Cooling (PI : S. KIM)
**&lt;ABSTRACT&gt;**
<div align="justify"> 
  One of the remarkable heat dissipation strategies, radiative coolerâ€™s performance can be greatly improved with increasing its emissivity over a broad range of mid-IR. This can be achieved by employing both dielectric materials and metals having the relatively larger penetration depth base on a tunneling effect. The simplest planar structure sandwiching an ultrathin metal between dielectric layers can lead an optical structure to be greatly close to blackbody. Furthermore, given the enhanced transmittance in visible spectrum, it will be applicable to a wide range of environments with different heat sources.
